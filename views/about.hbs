<h1>About Us</h1>

<div class="Flo">
    <p>When not building websites, Kash likes to explore his passion for drinking wine, tea and hiking with the Chief
        Happiness Officer. His favorite part of
        this building this website was getting the article algorithm to work! He was hangry most of the time, but is
        now glad it's all over.
